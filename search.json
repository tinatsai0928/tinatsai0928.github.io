    "text": "📊 Visual Insights & Workflow\n\n\n\nKNIME Workflow Screenshot\n\n\n\n1. Data Preprocessing\n\n\n\nData Preprocessing Screenshot\n\n\nTo transform 2,000 raw movie reviews into a structured format suitable for modeling, I developed a rigorous text-preprocessing pipeline in KNIME.\nThis process began with foundational data cleansing to address missing values and duplicates, followed by advanced NLP techniques to minimize linguistic noise.\nBy implementing Punctuation Erasure, Case Conversion, and Stop Word Filtering, I successfully standardized the text and eliminated non-essential vocabulary.\nThe final refinement involved Snowball Stemming to harmonize word variations, ensuring the model could capture core sentiments regardless of tense or syntax.\nThis comprehensive preparation resulted in a highly balanced dataset, providing a robust and bias-free foundation for the subsequent sentiment analysis.\n\n\n2. Strategic Market Insights\n\n📊 Topic Distribution☁️ Topic Word Clouds\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme Distribution Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord Clouds for Movie Themes\n\n\n\n\n\nBy implementing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, I extracted three distinct market themes from the review data to inform content investment strategies.\nThe analysis identified Horror Movies as a high-value category due to strong audience engagement with thrilling and realistic content.\nAdditionally, the findings highlighted that Cast and Music are decisive factors influencing viewer satisfaction and subscription retention.\nWhile genres such as War Dramas represented a smaller segment, the data suggested a niche but loyal audience for high-quality production in this area.\nThese strategic insights enable streaming platforms to optimize production budgets and refine recommendation algorithms, leveraging data to replicate the success of audience-centric hits such as Stranger Things.”\n\n\n3. Model Optimization\n\n🚗 Logistics Regression🌳Random Forest🌲 Decision Tree🪴 Naive Bayes\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme Distribution Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme Distribution Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme Distribution Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheme Distribution Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\nA comparative analysis of model metrics reveals significant variations in how different algorithms capture sentiment nuances. While the Decision Tree maintained a balanced performance across both classes, other models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes exhibited a strong bias toward negative sentiment, as evidenced by their high recall for ‘NEG’ but disproportionately low recall for ‘POS’.\nThis discrepancy suggests that linear and probabilistic classifiers struggled to identify the complex linguistic patterns associated with positive feedback in the dataset.\nIn contrast, the Random Forest and Decision Tree models achieved much higher F-measures for positive reviews, demonstrating their superior ability to handle the non-linear features and varied vocabulary found in movie critiques.\n\n\n\nModel Accuracy Bar Chart\n\n\nTo identify the most reliable classifier for movie sentiment, I benchmarked four distinct algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.\nAs illustrated in the accuracy comparison chart, the Decision Tree model emerged as the top performer with a leading accuracy of 68.1%, demonstrating superior adaptability to the unstructured nature of movie reviews.\nA deeper look into the class-level metrics reveals that the Decision Tree achieved a remarkable equilibrium by maintaining an F-measure of approximately 0.68 for both positive and negative categories.\nIn contrast, models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes showed a significant bias toward negative sentiment, evidenced by their exceptionally low recall for positive reviews.\nThis discrepancy suggests that while linear and probabilistic classifiers struggled to capture the nuanced vocabulary of favorable critiques, the tree-based approach effectively handled the non-linear features and varied vocabulary found in the dataset. By selecting the Decision Tree, I ensured a balanced predictive capability that accurately identifies both audience hits and critical failures without favoring a single sentiment class."

    "section": "💡 Reflection & Future Scope",
    "text": "💡 Reflection & Future Scope\n\nThe Challenge\nThe primary technical hurdle in this project was navigating the inherent subjectivity and nuanced language within the dataset. A significant source of potential error arose from the discrepancy between overall ratings and specific textual expressions; for instance, a reviewer might praise a film’s technical aspects while giving a low overall score, or vice-versa. This mismatch creates “noise” in the data labels, directly impacting the model’s ability to learn consistent sentiment patterns.\nWhile achieving a 68.1% accuracy with the Decision Tree provided a strong baseline, these results underscore the limitations of traditional machine learning in reconciling contradictory signals within a single review.\n\n\nFuture Scope\nTo transcend the performance ceiling caused by label ambiguity, the next phase of this research involves integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) through the OpenAI API.\nUnlike standard classifiers, generative AI can perform aspect-based sentiment analysis, allowing it to separate conflicting opinions within the same text. Although initial experiments were constrained by API latency, leveraging these models for more sophisticated emotional detection remains a key objective. Future iterations will focus on scaling the dataset and utilizing transformer-based architectures to track sentiment evolution, providing more dynamic intelligence for content investment strategies.\n\n\nStrategic Insight\nThis project reinforces the principle that data is a narrative tool rather than just a collection of metrics.\nBy bridging analytical rigor with market curiosity, I demonstrated how raw text can be converted into a blueprint for data-driven decision-making.\nThese insights allow streaming platforms to optimize production budgets and refine recommendation algorithms to align with specific viewer preferences—ensuring that content strategies are as compelling as the stories they aim to tell.\n\n← Back to Projects"

Data Elicitation\n\n\n\nPower BI Dashboard Screenshot\n\n\nTo ensure the proposed solution addressed the actual needs of the campus community, our team executed a systematic data elicitation phase centered on a comprehensive stakeholder survey.\n\nTargeted Engagement: The survey successfully captured insights across seven colleges where the College of Business represented the primary data source with 314 individual records. This broad distribution ensures that our findings reflect a comprehensive cross-section of the campus community.\n\nVolume and Representation: This process successfully yielded over 520+ high-quality responses, providing a statistically significant foundation to identify systemic issues rather than isolated incidents.\n\nGranular Insight Capture: Beyond simple ratings, the elicitation was structured to capture specific pain points regarding nighttime mobility and service response times, which directly informed our technical requirements for Azure-based tracking.\n\nDefining the Scope: The results from this elicitation served as the “Single Source of Truth” for the project, allowing us to prioritize the Night Escort Service as our primary optimization target based on objective community feedback.\n\n\n\n2. Strategic Concept - The Scalable Virtual Escort Ecosystem\n\nBridging the Scalability Gap: We identified that the primary barrier to campus safety at UT Dallas is the “one-to-one” escort model, where demand far outpaces police supply. Our concept pivots to a “one-to-many” monitoring framework, allowing limited personnel to oversee multiple safety sessions simultaneously.\n\nVirtual Guarding via Microsoft Ecosystem: By leveraging Microsoft Teams as the primary user interface, we lowered the barrier to entry for students, while Azure serves as the analytical backbone to monitor routes, deviations, and travel times in real-time.\n\nException-Based Intervention: The core logic shifts from constant manual patrolling to proactive risk detection. The system only triggers high-priority Adaptive Card alerts to Campus Safety when Azure detects anomalies (e.g., route deviation or overdue arrival), ensuring that specialized manpower is deployed only when necessary.\n\nData-Informed Security Strategy: Beyond immediate response, the integration of Power BI transforms individual “Safe Walks” into long-term strategic insights. This allows university leadership to identify high-risk zones and optimize campus infrastructure, such as improving lighting or adjusting patrol routes based on empirical evidence.\n\nOperational Efficiency & ROI: This virtual model significantly reduces the operational cost for the university while increasing student confidence, providing a high-impact safety solution without the need for additional physical headcount."

    "text": "💡 Reflection & Future Scope\n\nThe Challenge\nWhile the current prototype successfully validates the technical feasibility of a virtual escort system, two primary challenges were identified during the development and elicitation phases:\n\nMitigating Data Bias: Our data elicitation primarily captured responses from the College of Business (60%), which may introduce a demographic bias. To ensure the system’s universal applicability, future iterations should involve targeted outreach to underrepresented schools to capture a more diverse range of nighttime mobility patterns.\n\nInfrastructure & Implementation Costs: Although our prototype leverages existing Microsoft 365 infrastructure, a full-scale deployment would involve ongoing Azure consumption costs (e.g., API calls for location tracking, data storage, and AI processing). Managing these recurring software expenses while maintaining high system availability is a primary operational challenge.\n\nInfrastructure & Implementation Costs: Beyond initial development, ensuring the system’s long-term reliability requires dedicated technical maintenance. This includes monitoring cloud service health, updating security protocols for data privacy, and managing the integration between Teams and Azure to prevent service downtime during critical nighttime hours.\n\n\n\nFuture Scope\nTo evolve “Safe Walk” from a pilot project to an enterprise-grade campus solution, the following enhancements are proposed:\n\nPredictive AI Analytics: Transitioning from “reactive” monitoring to “predictive” safety. By applying machine learning to historical safety data, the system could suggest safer, better-lit alternative routes in real-time before a student even starts their walk.\n\nIoT & Smart City Integration: Integrating with campus infrastructure, such as smart street lighting that brightens automatically when an active “Safe Walk” is detected via Azure, creating a physical “safety corridor” for the user.\n\nUniversal Accessibility: Expanding the UI/UX within Teams to include voice-activated distress signals and multilingual support, ensuring that international students and those with disabilities can navigate the campus with equal confidence.\n\n\n← Back to Projects"

North Texas Food Bank\nRole: Volunteer | Plano | Sep 20, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteer in Food Bank\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeding Hope, One Package at a Time: Working at the Food Bank was a eye-opening experience that went far beyond just moving crates. It was about ensuring that every family in our community had access to a warm meal and a sense of security. Being part of this essential lifeline reminded me how much impact we can have when we all pitch in.\nWhat I’m proud of:\n\nGetting Things Done: I tackled the mountain of boxes with a “let’s do this” attitude, making sure everything was unpacked and organized so the rest of the team could work smoothly.\nTeam Spirit: I had a great time teaming up with a local student. We communicated constantly to make sure we were on the same page and hit our goals for the day.\nFinding Order in Chaos: I took pride in keeping our workspace neat and safe, systematically going through supplies to make sure every item was exactly where it needed to be.\n\n\n\n\n2. Trusted World\nRole: Volunteer | Garland | Oct 10, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteer in Trusted World\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving Back, One Box at a Time: I spent my time at Trusted World helping sort through mountains of clothing donations. It was a busy, hands-on experience, but there was something incredibly rewarding about organizing these items, knowing they would soon help someone in need start fresh.\nWhy I Loved It:\n\nTeam Energy: I loved working alongside other volunteers (including a great high school partner!). We kept each other motivated as we cleared through the boxes together.\nMaking it Tidy: There’s a special kind of satisfaction in taking a chaotic pile of donations and turning it into neatly categorized stacks, ready for distribution.\nSmall Acts, Big Impact: It was a reminder that even “simple” tasks like sorting and unpacking play a huge part in helping a community stay strong.\n\n\n\n\n3. Fu Jen University\nRole: Remote Mandarin Literature Tutor | New Taipei City | Feb,2024 - May, 2024\n\n📖 Slide Cover🍚 Food History🎬 Celebrities\n\n\n\n\n\n“The beginning of our journey—setting the stage for a world of stories.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Exploring global traditions through the lens of agriculture and culture.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Using cinema and storytelling to connect with our students’ imaginations.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing the Joy of Literature, One Story at a Time: Teaching Mandarin wasn’t just about textbooks; it was about opening a window to the world. I designed my own curriculum to ensure every lesson felt like an adventure. Whether we were analyzing film scripts or exploring the history of rice, my goal was to show students that literature is alive and connected to everything around us.\nWhat I’m proud of:\n\nMultimodal Learning: I integrated films, documentaries, and creative visuals to keep students fully engaged. For example, I used cinema to teach scriptwriting and storytelling logic, making classics feel modern and exciting.\nBroadening Horizons: In lessons like “Rice Culture,” I introduced international history and diverse food traditions. This helped students build language skills while developing a global perspective and an appreciation for different cultures.\nNurturing Character: Beyond grammar and vocabulary, I focused on cultivating emotional intelligence and cultural depth, encouraging students to grow into thoughtful individuals with a curiosity for the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly describe what you were doing in this photo.\n\n\nAnother great memory from the event."
