I recently earned my Master’s degree in Business Analytics and AI from The University of Texas at Dallas, following a solid foundation in Statistics and Information Science from Fu Jen Catholic University.\nMy journey in data is driven by a simple belief:\nData is more than just numbers; it’s a way to tell stories and support meaningful decisions.\nThrough my academic and project experiences, I have developed a robust toolkit in Python, R, and SQL, alongside visualization expertise in Tableau and Power BI.\n\n\n\nBeyond the Data: I am an avid traveler and a dedicated reader.\nFor me, exploring a new city and diving into a complex dataset share the same thrill—the joy of discovering hidden patterns and understanding diverse systems. I bring this same curiosity and “never-stop-learning” attitude to every project I take on.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Observing real-world systems\n    \n\n    \n      \n      Building structured thinking\n    \n\n    \n      \n      Turning patterns into decisions"
